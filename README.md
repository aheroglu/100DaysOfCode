Welcome to my **100 Days of Code** journey!  
This repository contains a collection of daily projects and code exercises that I build and share every day for 100 consecutive days.

## 🚀 What is This Challenge?

The **#100DaysOfCode** challenge is a commitment to code every single day for 100 days and publicly share progress.  
Through this journey, I'm aiming to:

- Sharpen my development skills
- Explore and build with various technologies
- Stay consistent and accountable
- Create a valuable portfolio of projects
- Share my learnings with the community

## 🛠️ Technologies Involved

Although my core stack includes **.NET** and **Angular**, this challenge is not limited to a single technology.  
I will be exploring various tools, libraries, and frameworks such as:

- ✅ .NET 8 / .NET Core Web API
- ✅ Angular
- ✅ SignalR
- ✅ OpenAI API
- ✅ REST APIs
- ✅ RxJS, Chart.js, Leaflet, and more
